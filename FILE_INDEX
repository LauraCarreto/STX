FILE 1:
stx_sambamba_fromFastq.py

Adapted from 'stx_subtyping.py'

Features:

1. Inputs a pair of Fastq files located in a given directory. All outputs will be found in this directory.
2. Uses Bowtie2 instead of BWA for read alignment to stx all references; creates directory 'Bowtie_out' where the sorted BAM file will be found.
3. Uses pysam to obtain a pileup description of the bases calls for each position along all references.
4. Summarises depth from the pysam pileup into two PDF files: A) boxplots of depth for all references, and B) how alignment depth changes along all references (red lines in these plots higlight the unique positions used for subtyping; the plots can be used for quality control and also to compare relative load of stx1 and stx2 genes in samples that have both types.
5. Outputs an XML file with the subtyping results in directory 'stx_subtyping_bowtie'; Stx subtype unique positions are used for identification; Default parameters include a minimum depth of 10 reads with a 40% frequency at the unique positions for subtype calling.
6.Outputs a summary file with the depth for base calls using Sambamba (SambambaOut.txt) into the 'Bowtie_out' directory. The file is used to derive: A)the average depth for alignments with Type1 subtypes (1a,1c,1d); B) the average depth for alignments with Type2 subtypes (2a, 2b, 2c, 2d, 2e, 2f, 2g); and C) the overall average depth from the alignments to all the references (STOUT).

FILE 2:
stx_sambamba_fromSortedBam_results_to_txt.py

Adapted from the above 'stx_sambamba_fromFastq.py'; same aligner and same usage as the above, but with different outputs.

Features:

1.Inputs sorted Bam files instead of Fastq files; The sorted BAM files should be in the directory 'Bowtie_out', which is created in the directory where the Fastq files are found.
2. Outputs the PDF files with A) boxplots of depth for all references, and B) how alignment depth changes along all references (as the above).
3. Iteratively changes the frequency of base calling at the unique positions that is required for subtype calling. The frequency values for iteration are currently set as 90%, 40%, 30%, 20%. 
4. Outputs the subtyping results to a text file instead of to an XML file. The text file (tab delimited) has no headers, but the frequency values are processed from larger to smaller.
5. Outputs A)the average depth for alignments with Type1 subtypes (1a,1c,1d); B) the average depth for alignments with Type2 subtypes (2a, 2b, 2c, 2d, 2e, 2f, 2g); and C) the overall average depth from the alignments to all the references (in this order), to a text file. The text file (tab delimited) has no headers, but the outputs are ordered from point A to point C.
6. If multiple samples are run simultaneously, the results will be appended to the same file (results file or depth summary file, respectively).

File 3: 
stx_sequence_fromSambambaFile.py

Adapted from 'stx_sambamba_fromSortedBam_results_to_txt.py'; same aligner and same usage as the above, but with a different output.

Features:

1. Should only be used with samples where only one subtype was confirmed by subtyping.This script does not perform subtype analysis.
2. Uses the SambambaOut.txt file from the directory 'Bowtie_out'(see above) to derive a sequence for a given stx subtype. The most frequent base found at a given position, in a minimum of 5 reads, is aded to the sequence. 
4. Outputs to terminal (STDOUT) and to a Fasta file. The latter can be found in the 'Bowtie_out' directory.
